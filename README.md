# hello-word
Meu primeiro reposit√≥rio 

I am transitioning my career to the development area. I studied programming in 2007, but I didn't follow this path, today thanks to my son and my wife I'm having all the support and affection to make this change. My mission is to acquire knowledge, industry interdependence and a Senior or Superior position in the industry.
My goal is to be a "Full Stack Developer" with high productive and participative capacity, working in Home Office. My vision is to add my knowledge to others using my communicative and creative skills, my life experience, resourcefulness and talent for teaching.
